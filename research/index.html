<p><strong>Heterogeneous effects of hospital competition on inpatient costs: An empirical analysis of diseases grouping basing on conditions’ complexity and urgency</strong><br>with Liyong Lu and Jay Pan<br><em><font color=#d53484>BMC Health Services Research</font></em>, 2021,21,1322. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-021-07331-1"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Differences in conditions’ complexity and urgency across diseases associating with various degrees of information asymmetry and choice autonomy in the process of care provision, would lead to heterogeneous effects of competition in the healthcare market. However, there are limited studies to explore it. This study aims to examine the heterogeneous effects of hospital competition on inpatient costs basing on disease grouping according to conditions’ complexity and urgency. Collecting information from the discharge data of inpatients and hospital administrative data of Sichuan province in China, we selected 19 representative diseases with significant burden based on the inpatient volume and costs, more than 1.1 million hospitalizations (about 35% of total hospitalizations) were included in the empirical analysis. Employing K-means clustering, the selected diseases were divided into three groups, including diseases with highly complex condition, diseases with urgent condition, and diseases with less complex and less urgent condition. Calculating Herfindahl-Hirschman Index based on the predicted patient flow to measure the hospital competition, and using the log-linear multivariate regression model, we found heterogeneous effects of hospital competition on inpatients costs across diseases groups: hospital competition could play a positive role in reducing inpatient costs of diseases with less complex and less urgent condition, but mixed effects for diseases with highly complex condition, while insignificant relationship for diseases with urgent condition. Our study reveals the fact that the differences in condition’s complexity and urgency among diseases would lead to different impacts of hospital competition, which would be given full consideration when designing the pro-competition policy in the healthcare delivery system to achieve the desired goal.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital market competition and health technology diffusion: an empirical study of the use of laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis in China</strong><br>with Liyong Lu and Jay Pan<br><em><font color=#d53484>Social Science &amp; Medicine</font></em>, 2021,286,114316. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953621006481?via=ihub"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>The evidence about the role of hospital market competition on health technology diffusion in developing countries is scarce. In this study, we examined the association between hospital market competition and the diffusion of health technologies in China’s healthcare system. Laparoscopic appendectomy, a minimally invasive surgery for patients with acute appendicitis, was selected as a representative of cost-effective health technology. The inpatient discharge dataset linked to the annually hospital administrative data and to the demographic and socioeconomic data were used. A total of 261,922 patients who were diagnosed with acute appendicitis and had received either open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy at 820 hospitals in Sichuan, China between 2017 and 2019 were included in our analyses. Our outcome measure was the use of laparoscopic appendectomy during hospitalization. We accounted for the endogeneity of hospital competition measures using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index calculated by predicted patient flows. Controlling for the observable patient, hospital and region characteristics, multivariate logistic regression was performed to model the association between hospital competition and the diffusion of laparoscopic appendectomy. The rapid diffusion of laparoscopic appendectomy over the study period and the substantial variation in use across regions and hospitals were observed. The regression results showed that laparoscopic appendectomy diffused faster in the markets where hospitals faced more competition. Our findings suggest that the diffusion of laparoscopic appendectomy is not only driven by medical factors but also nonmedical factors like hospital market competition. Our study provides new evidence on the association between market structure and technology diffusion in China’s hospital market and offers the implications of appropriate technologies diffusion in health for policymakers.</p>

<p><strong>Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Public Hospitals of Different Levels: Six-month Evidence from Shanghai, China</strong><br>with Yuqian Chen, Miao Cai, Zhipeng Li and Linan Wang<br><em><font color=#d53484>Risk Management and Healthcare Policy</font></em>, 2021,14,3635-3651. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dovepress.com/impacts-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-public-hospitals-of-different-leve-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-RMHP"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Purpose: Hospitals suffered from a precipitous loss of medical service globally due to COVID-19. The tragedy paradoxically produced an opportunity to investigate the patterns of hospitals at different levels when faced with a natural shock. This study aims to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 on hospital operation in Shanghai.<br>
Methods: We obtained monthly characteristic and operation longitudinal data of public hospitals (N=156) from January 1, 2018, to July 31, 2020, in Shanghai from the China Statistical Survey of Health Resources and Services Program. We constructed a set of difference-in-differences models to investigate the pandemic (from February 1 to March 31, 2020) and post-pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020) effects on operation outcomes of hospitals at different level, including outpatient visits, inpatient visits, outpatient revenue, and inpatient revenue, as well as the differential effects on local and nonlocal patients.<br>
Results: Compared to a non-tertiary hospital, a tertiary hospital experienced substantially larger losses in outpatient visits (57.91 thousand, p < 0.01), inpatient visits (1.93 thousand, p < 0.01), outpatient revenue (18.88 million RMB, p < 0.01), and inpatient revenue (30.65 million RMB, p < 0.01) monthly, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, a tertiary hospital lost more outpatient visits (18.02 thousand, p< 0.01), but was associated with higher outpatient revenue (0.87 million RMB, p < 0.01) and inpatient revenue (2.24 million RMB, p < 0.01) monthly, compared to a non-tertiary hospital.<br>
Conclusion: Medical service and revenue of public hospitals in Shanghai dropped precipitously during the COVID-19 pandemic, but mainly had recovered after the pandemic. Compared to non-tertiary hospitals, tertiary hospitals' medical services and revenue experienced more substantial reduction during the pandemic but faster and longer recovery during the post-pandemic period.</p>

<p><strong>Perceived Competition and Process of Care in Rural China</strong><br>with Weiyan Jian, Winnie Yip and Jay Pan<br><em><font color=#d53484>Risk Management and Healthcare Policy</font></em>, 2020,13:1161-1173. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dovepress.com/perceived-competition-and-process-of-care-in-rural-china-peer-reviewed-article-RMHP"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Purpose: Although there is much debate about the effect of hospital competition on healthcare quality, its impact on the process of care remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether hospital competition improves the process of care in rural China.<br>
Patients and Methods: The county hospital questionnaire survey data and the randomly sampled medical records of bacterial pneumonia patients in 2015 in rural area of Guizhou, China, were used in this study. The processes of care for bacterial pneumonia were measured by the following three measures: 1) oxygenation assessment, 2) antibiotic treatment, and 3) first antibiotic treatment within 6 hours after admission. Hospital competition was measured by asking hospital directors to rate the competition pressure they perceive from other hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to determine the relationship between perceived competition and the processes of care for patients with bacterial pneumonia.<br>
Results: A total of 2167 bacterial pneumonia patients from 24 county hospitals in 2015 were included in our study. Our results suggested that the likelihood of receiving antibiotic treatment and first antibiotic treatment within 6 hours after admission was significantly higher in the hospitals perceiving higher competition pressure. However, no significant relationship was found between perceived competition and oxygenation assessment for patients with bacterial pneumonia.<br>
Conclusion: This study revealed the role of perceived competition in improving the process of care under the fee-for-service payment system and provided empirical evidence to support the pro-competition policies in China’s new round of national healthcare reform.</p>

<p><strong>Holiday and weekend effects on mortality for acute myocardial infarction in Shanxi, China: A cross-sectional study</strong><br>with Jeremy C. Green, Hong Xian, Miao Cai, Julia Skrzypek and Hongbing Tao<br><em><font color=#d53484>International Journal of Public Health</font></em>, 2020,65(6):847-857. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-020-01443-x"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Objectives: To examine the effects of holiday and weekend admission on in-hospital mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in China.<br>
Methods: Patients with AMI in 31 tertiary hospitals in Shanxi, China from 2014 to 2017 were included (N = 54,968). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of holiday and weekend admission on in-hospital mortality.<br>
Results: Compared to non-holiday and weekday admissions, holiday and weekend admissions, respectively, were associated with increases in risk-adjusted mortality rates. Chinese National Day was associated with an additional 10 deaths per 1000 admissions (95% confidence interval (CI): (0, 20))—a relative increase from baseline mortality of 64% (95% CI: (1%, 128%)). Sunday was associated with an additional 4 deaths per 1000 admissions (95% CI: (0, 7))—a relative increase from baseline mortality of 23% (95% CI: (3%, 45%)). We found no evidence of gender differences in holiday or weekend effects on mortality.<br>
Conclusions: Holiday and weekend admissions were associated with in-hospital AMI mortality. The admissions on Chinese National Day and Sunday contributed to the observed “holiday effect” and “weekend effect,” respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital volume and outcomes for inpatients with acute myocardial infarction in Shanxi, China: A cross-sectional study</strong><br>with Ziling Ni, Ying Wang, Tianyu Jiang and Hongbing Tao<br><em><font color=#d53484>The International Journal of Health Planning and Management</font></em>, 2019,34(4):1195–1204. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hpm.2787"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>In this cross‐sectional study, we assessed the relationship between hospital volume and clinical outcomes for inpatients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in tertiary A hospitals in Shanxi, China (N = 12 931). In‐hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total cost were measured. The crude in‐hospital mortality rate was 1.69%. Adjusted in‐hospital mortality was significantly lower for medium‐volume hospitals (odds ratio (OR) = 0.605, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.411‐0.900) compared with low‐volume hospitals. LOS in medium‐ and high‐volume hospitals were 0.915 (95% CI = 0.880‐0.951) and 1.069 (95% CI = 1.041‐1.098) days longer than in low‐volume hospitals, respectively. The cost of inpatients attending low‐ and high‐volume hospitals (OR = 1.180, 95% CI = 1.140‐1.221) was higher than that of medium‐volume hospitals (OR = 0.897, 95% CI = 0.868‐0.926). These results inform health care policy in countries with strained medical resources.</p>

<p><strong>Does hospital competition harm inpatient quality?

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>This study aimed to determine whether hospital competition is associated with improved in-hospital mortality in Shanxi, China. We included a total of 46,959 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 44,063 hospitalizations for pneumonia from 2015 to 2017. Hospital competition was measured as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index based on the patient predicted flow approach. Two-level random-intercept logistic models were applied to explore the effects of hospital competition on quality for both AMI and pneumonia diagnoses. Hospital competition exerts negative or negligible effects on inpatient quality of care, and the pattern of competition effects on quality varies by specific diseases. While hospital competition is insignificantly correlated with lower AMI in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77–1.11), high hospital competition was, in fact, associated with higher in-hospital mortality for pneumonia patients (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.51–2.64). Our study suggests that simply encouraging hospital competition may not provide effective channels to improve inpatient quality of health care in China’s current health care system.</p>

<p><strong>Insurance status, inhospital mortality and length of stay in hospitalised patients in Shanxi, China: a cross-sectional study</strong><br>with  Miao Cai, Hongbing Tao, Echu Liu, Zhaohui Cheng, Chang Xu, Manli Wang, Shuxu Xia and Tianyu Jiang<br><em><font color=#d53484>BMJ Open</font></em>, 2017,7(7), e015884. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/7/e015884"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Objectives: To determine insurance-related disparities in hospital care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF) and pneumonia.<br>
Setting and participants: A total of 22 392 patients with AMI, 8056 patients with HF and 17 161 patients with pneumonia were selected from 31 tertiary hospitals in Shanxi, China, from 2014 to 2015 using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Patients were stratified by health insurance status, namely, urban employee-based basic medical insurance (UEBMI), urban resident-based basic medical insurance (URBMI), new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) and self-payment.<br>
Outcome measures: Inhospital mortality and length of stay (LOS).<br>
Results: The highest unadjusted inhospital mortality rate was detected in NCMS patients independent of medical conditions (4.7%, 4.4% and 11.1% for AMI, HF and pneumonia, respectively). The lowest unadjusted inhospital mortality rate and the longest LOS were observed in UEBMI patients. After controlling patient-level and hospital-level covariates, the adjusted inhospital mortality was significantly higher for NCMS and self-payment among patients with AMI, for NCMS among patients with HF and for URBMI, NCMS and self-payment among patients with pneumonia compared with UEBMI. The LOS of the URBMI, NCMS and self-payment groups was significantly shorter than that of the UEBMI group.<br>
Conclusion: Insurance-related disparities in hospital care for patients with three common medical conditions were observed in this study. NCMS patients had significantly higher adjusted inhospital mortality and shorter LOS compared with UEBMI patients. Policies on minimising the disparities among different insurance schemes should be established by the government.</p>

<p><strong>A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Hospital Volume and the Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</strong><br>with Hongbing Tao, Miao Cai, Aihua Liao, Zhaohui Cheng and Haifeng Lin<br><em><font color=#d53484>Medicine</font></em>, 2016,95(5):e2687. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748925/"><font color=#4169E1>Article</font></a></p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Previous reviews have suggested that hospital volume is inversely related to in-hospital mortality. However, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) practices have changed substantially in recent years, and whether this relationship persists remains controversial. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies that describe the effect of hospital volume on the outcomes of PCI. Critical appraisals of the methodological quality and the risk of bias were conducted independently by 2 authors. Fourteen of 96 potentiality relevant articles were included in the analysis. Twelve of the articles described the relationship between hospital volume and mortality and included data regarding odds ratios (ORs); 3 studies described the relationship between hospital volume and long-term survival, and only 1 study included data regarding hazard ratios (HRs). A meta-analysis of postoperative mortality was performed using a random effects model, and the pooled effect estimate was significantly in favor of high volume providers (OR: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.86; P < 0.001). A systematic review of long-term survival was performed, and a trend toward better long-term survival in high volume hospitals was observed. This meta-analysis only included studies published after 2006 and revealed that postoperative mortality following PCI correlates significantly and inversely with hospital volume. However, the magnitude of the effect of volume on long-term survival is difficult to assess. Additional research is necessary to confirm our findings and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the volume–outcome relationship.</p>
